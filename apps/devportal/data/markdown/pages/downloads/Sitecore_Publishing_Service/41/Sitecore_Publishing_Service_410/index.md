The Sitecore Publishing Service is an opt-in service providing an alternative to the default Sitecore publishing mechanism focusing on increased performance by doing operations in bulk. It uses a different approach than the default publishing mechanism and is not a like for like replacement. There are differences to UI, integration points, deployment and in some cases publishing behavior.

See [all available Sitecore Publishing Service versions here](/downloads/Sitecore_Publishing_Service).

Integration of this service into Sitecore Experience Platform also requires the Sitecore Publishing Services Module. See [all available Module versions here](/downloads/Sitecore_Publishing_Service_Module).
